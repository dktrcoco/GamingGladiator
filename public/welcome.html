                    <p>Welcome Olympians!! Before you lies your chance for honor and glory within the Coliseum, where you will be able to test your mettle against fellow competitors/rivals in competitions spanning multiple matches and different challenges all revolving around the game: "Overwatch!"</p>
                    <p>Whether your opponents be friends or foes matters not, as once a competition ends there can be only one standing at the peak!</p>
                    <p>Invite your friends for competitions of skill or face down rivals in one-on-ones by entering their usernames into the competitor list.</p>
                    <p>Upon deciding how many matches the competition will cover (1, 3, or 5 matches), the battle mode must be determined so the Coliseum may pull the relevant data from each competitor to crown the victor.</p>

                        <hr>
                        <li>High Score Hero: The Coliseum tallies the scores of each Olympian, the winner being the Olympian with the highest overall.</li>
                        <br>
                        <li>King of the Kills: Points nor deaths matter not here, only how many foes you defeat does. The Olympian with the highest number of kills claims the crown.</li>
                        <br>
                        <li>K/D Clash: The truest test of skill for any Olympian, can you defeat more enemies than can defeat you? The Coliseum averages a Olympian's K/D over each match, yet only the Olympian with the best K/D average will stand the victor.</li>
