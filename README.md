## Questions

If you have any questions that are not answered, please feel free to reach out to any of us at our email (listed above). 

You can also reach us through GitHub directly via our accounts (listed above).

## Future

As our code is structured currently, we will need to implement a limitation to the number of accounts that can be entered into the competition.

Other areas of improvement include:

    *expanding the competition to include other stats besides gold medals
    
    *adding a log-in feature

    *allowing the user to select the type of competition (medals, kills, etc)

    *adding in-game sound effects

    *adding a timed functionality to indicate the end of the competition

    *expanding the app to include other games, such as Fortnite, Call of Duty: Modern Warefare, Grand Theft Auto Tournament, Apex Legends, Counter-Strike Go
