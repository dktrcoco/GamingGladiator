            <h2>The Coliseum Welcomes You</h2>
            <hr>
            <p>Gamers, before you lies the chance for glory; however, nothing so grand ever come so easily. Upon entering the Coliseum, you will test your mettle against fellow Gladiators in competitions spanning multiple matches and different challenges in a video game of your choosing. Whether your opponents be friends or foes matters not, as once a competition ends there can be only one standing at the peak.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Invite your friends for competitions of skill or face down rivals in one-on-ones, regardless of the systems (PC, Playstation, Xbox) a competitor uses, by entering their username into the competitor list.</p>
            <p>Upon deciding how many matches the competition will cover (1, 3, or 5 matches), the battle mode must be determined so the Coliseum may pull the relevant data from each competitor to crown the victor.</p>
            <br>
            <ul> Battle Modes:
                <li>High Score Hero: The Coliseum tallies the scores of each Gladiator, the winner being the Gladiator with the highest total score.</li>
                <li>King of the Kills: Points nor deaths matter not here, only how many foes you defeat does. The Gladiator with the highest number of kills claims the crown.</li>
                <li>K/D Clash: The truest test of skill for any Gladiator, can you defeat more enemies than can defeat you? The Coliseum averages a Gladiator's K/D over each match, yet only the Gladiator with the best K/D average will stand the victor. </li>
            </ul>
